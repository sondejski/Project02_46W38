The results show that the blade deflection increases with wind speed up to around 10–11 m/s and then starts to drop slightly at higher speeds. This happens because the thrust on the blades grows with wind speed at first, but the thrust coefficient 
decreases once the turbine reaches its rated region, which reduces the overall loading.

When comparing different turbulence intensities, both the mean and standard deviation of the blade displacement are higher for larger TI values. In other words, more turbulence leads to bigger and more irregular blade motions. The shape of the curves is similar for all TI cases, but the amplitude of the fluctuations increases with TI.

Overall, the trends make sense physically: stronger and more turbulent winds produce greater average deflection and higher variability in the blade response, while the tower motion stays small because only the blade side was directly excited in this simple model.
